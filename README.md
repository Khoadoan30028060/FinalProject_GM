This project is seperated into two main parts:

- Task 1: Studying and demonstrating algorithms, methodologies, and tech-niques that were presented by the lecturer.
- Task 2: Researching the recent advances in the graph deep learning domain. 

## Task 1: Frequent subgraph mining - Graph Partition - Node Embedding

1) Frequent Subgraph Mining:

- Common pattern finding method based on Apriori: __FSG__
- Depth-based common pattern finding method: __gSpan__
- Greedy frequent pattern finding method: __Subdue__

2) Graph Partition: 
- Girvan Newman and Edge betweenness
- Spectral clustering
- Louvain 
- Label propagation

3) Node Embedding: 
- Deepwalk
- Node2vec
## Task 2: HOPE-Net: A Graph-based Model for Hand-Object Pose Estimation

Codes for [**HOPE-Net paper**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.00060.pdf) (CVPR 2020), a Graph Convolutional model for Hand-Object Pose Estimation (HOPE).
